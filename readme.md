# Unitree MuJoCo - Quadruped Walking & Balancing Demo

This is a fork of the [Unitree MuJoCo](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_mujoco) repository, with an added demo showcasing a very basic walking and balancing controller for a quadruped robot.

This code is far from clean. It contains many leftover debugging statements, quick hacks, and rough fixes. It was created primarily for learning and experimentation purposes and is not intended for production or serious use.
